    "Description": "Vatsim data file is refreshed only cca per 2 minutes, so there is no need to have 30sec and 60sec refresh interval. Moreover, VATSIM server will deny requestes with this timing saying that you are downloading data-file too often.\r\n\r\nCan you please add 2 (3, 5) minutes refresh intervals for VATSIM data?",
